Hi, there! I'm Ignacio Vallejos, a web developer born and raised in Argentina. Passionate about programming, I'm currently working as a freelancer, building solutions based on my clients needs, from a simple website to a web application.

Apart from studying Computer Science, I'm also addicted to online courses, in which I aquired most of my knowledge. Here is a list of my main skills and the technologies that I feel more comfortable working with.
